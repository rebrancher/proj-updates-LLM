# fsys

A filesystem written using python3 to integrate LLM's into a journal-esqe type application. 

The goal is to have a clear record of user input in longer prompts, and then have an LLM run in parallel to present new ideas or further analysis.

Any LLM that has an API would be able to run in this product.
