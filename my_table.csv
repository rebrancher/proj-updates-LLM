update_date,update_time,update_text
06-09-2023,16:25:11,Add iOS functionality
06-09-2023,16:28:43,See if there is a way to have a gui from terminal
06-09-2023,16:28:51,"hire iOS dev, ask Ameen"
06-10-2023,12:23:08,"Understand the best UI, maybe find a book?"
06-10-2023,12:23:24,How to deal with longer responses? what happense when I go too far like I am doing now?
06-10-2023,12:31:26,Add indent to double lined responses
06-10-2023,17:05:52,After delete functionality - work through code to understand how the task_ID is going to be met
06-10-2023,18:50:18,When repopulating list - after a delete for master tasks re fill the lost taskID w new task
06-10-2023,21:22:32,remove lines in date column
06-10-2023,21:22:46,Think about how to host on a server and then ping with an ssh client
06-10-2023,21:24:14,could have separate API for phone that makes it easier to read on phone(basically witout table)
06-11-2023,10:28:55,FEATURE IDEA: keep the downward scrolling but add a link feature that highlights like tasks...
06-11-2023,14:03:50,Is this predefined structure worth it? Should you just have some underlying data structures? Or come out with a usecase first...
06-11-2023,14:04:27,I think the progress you have made so far is largely from working through one use-case. Dont think too far ahead just yet. Time and place.
06-11-2023,14:05:06,Should you focus on making the app look nice in Terminal? Might be the way in which you begin to really enjoy using it.
06-11-2023,14:05:58,This means you have to focus on spacing and really diving into the rich library.
06-11-2023,14:06:32,"This would make you much more reliant on your macbook, but it is way more powerful so perhaps it is the way to go."
06-11-2023,15:01:48,Maybe also group by hour...
06-11-2023,15:02:50,But what if you are working on the cusp of an hour? Allow for hourlyy automatically or should you do a group function?
06-11-2023,15:35:10,FEATURE: make sure you can see all tasks in the flow for adding a new task
06-11-2023,15:35:44,Also make sure in the options menu after adding a new task you also see all tasks.
06-13-2023,07:56:48,"Spacing, last 10?"
06-13-2023,15:30:37,"add ""c' to cancel"
06-14-2023,15:42:47,Press any key to continue should work even without pressing enter. Or just say hit enter? >? Then take away text
06-14-2023,15:43:20,Consider a MT mode and an Update mode?
06-14-2023,15:44:13,Another idea is to start with the update menu rather than the meta menu
06-14-2023,16:06:43,"Or consolidate to just 3 options, MT, Updates, and Highlights?"
06-14-2023,16:06:52,Add option to link to previous task
06-14-2023,16:08:21,Only allow edits for about 1 minute after input
06-14-2023,16:10:58,"""Tomorrow"" Feature that allows the user to select 5 updates that they can then uhighlight for use the next day"
06-14-2023,16:11:35,add c to cancel in the highlight menu
06-14-2023,16:11:55,"Instead of ""Option menu"" should you continually add tasks until you press c to cancel?"
06-16-2023,17:13:45,Think through list and groups within updates
06-16-2023,17:14:22,"add an ""edit last task"" option in the options menu after an edit is added"
06-16-2023,17:18:30,"Add ""Completion date? on the right side? Would that turn it into a task related thing?"
06-16-2023,17:19:01,What is the main reason for the 300 character limit then? Shuold you give an example of  what that looks like for reference?
06-16-2023,17:19:55,"Be able to select a range of tasks and update with a ""Summary?"" GOOD IDEA"
06-16-2023,17:21:10,"The problem is with indices, you want to maintain indices I think, so new things can then be like 37a or 37-1"
06-16-2023,17:21:57,I think maintain the forward nature of time and date
06-17-2023,11:28:57,Updates -> Shows all master tasks -> Shows all updates relating to master task -> Option to add task or main menu from there
06-17-2023,14:24:27,"Added two new options, one is single menu and the other is having 3 menus"
06-18-2023,10:48:34,Make the column widith more for master tasks duh
06-18-2023,10:48:53,Add exit option
