06-11-2023,14:03:50,Is this predefined structure worth it? Should you just have some underlying data structures? Or come out with a usecase first...,
06-11-2023,14:04:27,I think the progress you have made so far is largely from working through one use-case. Dont think too far ahead just yet. Time and place.,

06-11-2023,14:05:58,This means you have to focus on spacing and really diving into the rich library.,

But... I am not so sure that coding it will be the start of what needs to happen.",
06-27-2023,14:54:12,"In the mean time, however, there can be a seperate feature of intereacting with chatGPT in a way where you can log what happens for your own writing. For example, some of your posts get drawn out with language that is not so beneficial. It is almost as if your priority is getting things out rather than actually focusing oon the content of what you are writing. This new bot could help you reorganize your thoughts so that eventually you learn how to organize them better rather than focusing on how youre coming across while you are writing.",

06-30-2023,22:20:37,"Sure, let's delve deeper into how these features can be implemented from a technical standpoint:",
06-30-2023,22:20:37,"1. **Multiple updates or drafts:** To implement this, you could use a tab-based interface where each tab represents a draft. This would allow the user to switch between drafts easily. The drafts could be stored in a local database or remote server and fetched when needed. Each draft would have a unique ID to differentiate between them. ",
06-30-2023,22:20:37,"2. **Edit option for longer posts:** On the backend, you would need a route or API endpoint that takes the ID of the post to be edited and the new content as parameters. This endpoint would then update the post in the database. On the front end, you could have an edit button next to each post that opens a text box pre-filled with the existing content. When the user is done editing, the content would be sent to the backend to update the post.",
06-30-2023,22:20:37,"3. **Completion date feature:** On the frontend, you could add a date-time picker in the task creation/editing interface. On the backend, you would need to modify your database schema to include a new field for the completion date in your task table. Whenever a task is created or edited, this field would be updated. You would also need to modify your task retrieval queries to include the completion date.",
06-30-2023,22:20:37,"4. **Change update menu to default:** This would involve modifying your front-end routing or navigation so that users are directed to the update menu by default. For instance, if you're using React, you might use a `<Redirect>` component to automatically send users to the update menu.",
06-30-2023,22:20:37,"5. **Restriction on single character updates:** You would need to add validation both on the frontend and the backend. On the frontend, you could use JavaScript to prevent the form from being submitted if the update is too short. On the backend, you could also include a check before the update is processed to ensure it meets the minimum length requirement. This way, even if someone bypasses the frontend validation, the backend would still catch it.",
